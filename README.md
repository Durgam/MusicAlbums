I have considered the VIPER architecture for this requirement. VIPER has so many advantages and less disadvantages. 

Below are the advantages

Simplifies complex projects.
Decouples the code for reusability and testability
Divides the application components based on its role
Sets clear responsibilities , Viper is a champion in distribution of responsibilities
Makes it easy to add new features
Makes it easy to write automated tests since your UI logic is separated from the business logic
It encourages a separation of concerns that makes it easier to adopt TDD. The Interactor contains pure logic that is independent of any UI, which makes it easy to drive with tests
Makes it easy to use
Creates clear and well-defined interfaces, independent of other modules. This makes it much easier to change the way your interface presents various modules to the user.
Makes it easier to track issues via crash reports due to the Single Responsibility Principle
Makes the source code cleaner, more compact and reusable
It provides better decoupling of the UI and business logic. This decoupling results in thin, flexible, and easy-to-read view controller classes.
